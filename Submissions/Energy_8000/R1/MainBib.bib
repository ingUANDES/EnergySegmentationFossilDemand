	abstract = {The objective of the paper is to generate an energy and environmental model using LEAP to forecast energy demand, supply, emissions for Chile by 2030 and create scenarios considering different policies motivated by current policy as well as national and international commitments from Chile. This paper contributes to literature by developing a long-term energy plan including all sectors for Chile, describing energy scenario alternatives and analyzing current policy, nationally determined contributions and sustainable development goals. Results indicate that scenarios with significant energy demand reduction for all sectors showed considerable emission reduction by 2030. In all scenarios, demand sector showed major contribution to emissions when compared to transformation sector. Although emissions from transformation sector demonstrate significant reduction by 2030, decrease in demand side is not clearly noticed for some scenarios. Chile requires appropriate energy efficiency and renewable energy policies for demand sides of sectors especially transport, mining and other industries to reduce emissions at demand-side as having decarbonization for transformation side. Scenarios including more wind, PVsolar, CSPsolar and hydropower plants reached more than 80\% renewable electricity generation by 2030. Thus, cleaner production portfolio which results in fewer emissions and more diversification in terms of energy generation can be established in Chile.},

	abstract     = {Summary: This addition to the ISOR series introduces complementarity models in a straightforward and approachable manner and uses them to carry out an in-depth analysis of energy markets, including formulation issues and solution techniques. In a nutshell, complementarity models generalize: a. optimization problems via their Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions b. non-cooperative games in which each player may be solving a separate but related optimization problem with potentially overall system constraints (e.g., market-clearing conditions) c. economic and engineering problems that aren't specifically derived from optimization problems (e.g., spatial price equilibria) d. problems in which both primal and dual variables (prices) appear in the original formulation (e.g., The National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) or its precursor, PIES). As such, complementarity models are a very general and flexible modeling format. A natural question is why concentrate on energy markets for this complementarity approach? As it turns out, energy or other markets that have game theoretic aspects are best modeled by complementarity problems. The reason is that the traditional perfect competition approach no longer applies due to deregulation and restructuring of these markets and thus the corresponding optimization problems may no longer hold. Also, in some instances it is important in the original model formulation to involve both primal variables (e.g., production) as well as dual variables (e.g., market prices) for public and private sector energy planning. Traditional optimization problems can not directly handle this mixing of primal and dual variables but complementarity models can and this makes them all that more effective for decision-makers.

We also develop a sensitivity metric to quantify uncertainty propagation by determining the change in the variance of the output due to a change in the variance of an input parameter. The covariance matrix of the solution variables quantifies the uncertainty in the output and pairs correlated variables and parameters. The sensitivity metric helps in identifying the parameters that cause maximum fluctuations in the output. The method developed in this paper optimizes the use of gradients and matrix multiplications which makes it particularly useful for large-scale problems. Having developed this method, we extend the deterministic version of the North American Natural Gas Model (NANGAM), to incorporate effects due to uncertainty in the parameters of the demand function, supply function, infrastructure costs, and investment costs. We then use the sensitivity metrics to identify the parameters that impact the equilibrium the most.},

In the first one, individuals can fully hedge the payments of segmented financial contracts by trading unsegmented assets. In the second one, it is assumed that agents may compensate with increments in present demand the losses of well-being generated by reductions of future consumption.},

	abstract = {We cast models of the generation capacity expansion type formally developed for the monopoly regime into equilibrium models better adapted for a competitive environment. We focus on some of the risks faced today by investors in generation capacity and thus pose the problem as a stochastic equilibrium model. We illustrate the approach on the problem of the incentive to invest. Agents can be risk neutral or risk averse. We model risk aversion through the CVaR of plants' profit. The CVaR induces risk-adjusted probabilities according to which investors value their plants. The model is formulated as a complementarity problem (including the CVaR valuation of investments). An illustration is provided on a small problem that captures several features of today's electricity world: a choice often restricted to coal and gas units, a peaky load curve because of wind penetration, uncertain fuel prices, and an evolving carbon market. We assess the potential of the approach by comparing energy-only and capacity market organizations in this risky environment. Our results can be summarized as follows: a deterministic analysis overlooks some changes of capacity structure induced by risk, whether in the capacity market or energy-only organizations. The risk-neutral analysis also misses a shift towards less capital-intensive technologies that may result from risk aversion. Last, risk aversion also increases the shortage of capacity compared to the risk-neutral view in the energy-only market when the price cap is low. This may have a dramatic impact on the bill to the final consumer. The approach relies on mathematical programming techniques and can be extended to full-size problems. The results are illustrative and may deserve more investigation.},

	abstract = {We present a set of power investment models, the class of risky capacity equilibrium problems, reflecting different assumptions of perfect and imperfect markets. The models are structured in a unified stochastic Nash game framework. Each model is the concatenation of a model of the short-term market operations (perfect competition or Cournot), with a long-term model of investment behavior (risk neutral and risk averse behavior under different assumptions of risk trading). The models can all be formulated as complementarity problems, some of them having an optimization equivalent. We prove existence of solutions and report numerical results to illustrate the relevance of market imperfections on welfare and investment behavior. The models are constructed and discussed as two stage problems but we show that the extension to multistage is achieved by a change of notation and a standard assumption on multistage risk functions. We also treat a large multistage industrial model to illustrate the computational feasibility of the approach.},

	abstract = {In many liberalized electricity markets, power generators can receive payments for maintaining capacity through capacity markets. These payments help stabilize generator revenues, making investment in capacity more attractive for risk-averse investors when other outlets for risk trading are limited. Here we develop a heuristic algorithm to solve large-scale stochastic equilibrium models describing a competitive market with incomplete risk trading. Introduction of a capacity mechanism has an asymmetric effect on the risk profile of different generation technologies, tilting the resource mix towards those with lower fixed costs and higher operating costs. One implication of this result is that current market structures may be ill-suited to financing low-carbon resources, the most scalable of which have high fixed costs and near-zero operating costs. Development of new risk trading mechanisms to replace or complement current capacity obligations could lead to more efficient outcomes.},
