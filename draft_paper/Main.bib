Readers will find a comprehensive treatment of the computation of equilibria arising from engineering, economics, and finance; chapter-ending exercises and "Notes and References" sections that make it equally useful for a graduate-level course or for self-study; corrections and revisions of difficult passages from the 1992 edition; and an updated bibliography. Audience: researchers and graduate students in fields including optimization, game theory, and finance, and diverse engineering disciplines, especially computer science and mechanical engineering.

	abstract     = {Summary: This addition to the ISOR series introduces complementarity models in a straightforward and approachable manner and uses them to carry out an in-depth analysis of energy markets, including formulation issues and solution techniques. In a nutshell, complementarity models generalize: a. optimization problems via their Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions b. non-cooperative games in which each player may be solving a separate but related optimization problem with potentially overall system constraints (e.g., market-clearing conditions) c. economic and engineering problems that aren't specifically derived from optimization problems (e.g., spatial price equilibria) d. problems in which both primal and dual variables (prices) appear in the original formulation (e.g., The National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) or its precursor, PIES). As such, complementarity models are a very general and flexible modeling format. A natural question is why concentrate on energy markets for this complementarity approach? As it turns out, energy or other markets that have game theoretic aspects are best modeled by complementarity problems. The reason is that the traditional perfect competition approach no longer applies due to deregulation and restructuring of these markets and thus the corresponding optimization problems may no longer hold. Also, in some instances it is important in the original model formulation to involve both primal variables (e.g., production) as well as dual variables (e.g., market prices) for public and private sector energy planning. Traditional optimization problems can not directly handle this mixing of primal and dual variables but complementarity models can and this makes them all that more effective for decision-makers.

The algorithm is shown to be globally convergent under assumptions which generalize those required to obtain similar results in the smooth case.

We also develop a sensitivity metric to quantify uncertainty propagation by determining the change in the variance of the output due to a change in the variance of an input parameter. The covariance matrix of the solution variables quantifies the uncertainty in the output and pairs correlated variables and parameters. The sensitivity metric helps in identifying the parameters that cause maximum fluctuations in the output. The method developed in this paper optimizes the use of gradients and matrix multiplications which makes it particularly useful for large-scale problems. Having developed this method, we extend the deterministic version of the North American Natural Gas Model (NANGAM), to incorporate effects due to uncertainty in the parameters of the demand function, supply function, infrastructure costs, and investment costs. We then use the sensitivity metrics to identify the parameters that impact the equilibrium the most.},
